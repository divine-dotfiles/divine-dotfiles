This file lists features present in the *Divine.dotfiles* framework, but not yet documented in its `README`.
The lack of documentation is mostly due to the feature's incomplete state of implementation.
Some of these features may already be present in the stable release of the framework.

* The `inject` helpers that inject textual chunks into text files.
* The `pkg-queue` specialized queue that mirrors the functions of the Divinefiles.
* The `d` flag for packages in the Divinefile.
