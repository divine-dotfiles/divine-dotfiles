In the `README`:

* [**`fix`**] Improve the presentation of the framework (un)installation command to make it single-line and wrapping visually on Github. This is also intended for pasting into non-Bash shells.
* [**`other`**] Reword the reasoning behind choosing Bash as the language of the framework.
