New machine or new OS?
Set it up with a single `*di install --yes*`.

NOTE: `di` stands for **d**ivine **i**ntervention

_Divine.ditfiles_ lets you keep your set-up scripts as isolated *deployments* that are installed/removed in defined sequence.
Here’s what a deployment file may look like:

[source,bash]
----
# dpl/example.dpl.sh

# Special function that checks whether this deployment is installed
dcheck() {
  if [ -e ~/bin/cmd ]; then return 1; else return 2; fi
}

# Special function that installs this deployment
dinstall() {
  printf 'echo Divine.dotfiles is cool\n' >~/bin/cmd && chmod +x ~/bin/cmd
}

# Special function that removes this deployment
dremove() {
  rm -f -- ~/bin/cmd
}
----

And here’s how working with it looks like:

## Installing and removing

### Installing

Run the following single command in Terminal:

[source,bash]
----
bash -c "$( URL=https://raw.github.com/no-simpler/divine-dotfiles/master/lib/install/install.sh; if command -v curl >/dev/null 2>&1; then curl -fsSL $URL; elif command -v wget >/dev/null 2>&1; then wget -qO - $URL; else printf >&2 '\n==> Unable to install: failed to detect neither curl nor wget\n'; fi )"
----

NOTE: Installation is completely safe: it clones/downloads repository and creates one symlink.
Oh, and it asks for your permission for everything.

### Removing

Run the following single command in Terminal:

[source,bash]
----
bash -c "$( URL=https://raw.github.com/no-simpler/divine-dotfiles/master/lib/uninstall/uninstall.sh; if command -v curl >/dev/null 2>&1; then curl -fsSL $URL; elif command -v wget >/dev/null 2>&1; then wget -qO - $URL; else printf >&2 '\n==> Unable to uninstall: failed to detect neither curl nor wget\n'; fi )"
----

NOTE: After asking for permission, this will erase entire installation directory, with all deployments in it.
Be careful.
