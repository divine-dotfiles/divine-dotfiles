## Part of Divine.dotfiles <https://github.com/no-simpler/divine-dotfiles>
#
## This is an annotated example of a Divinefile.
#
## A Divinefile is a list of packages to be maintained - checked/installed/
#. removed along with the deployments - using the supported system package 
#. manger.
#
## For the full reference, see the README file of the framework.
#

(os:all )         # This is redundant, as it is the default

(priority: 300)   # Set the priority to 300 henceforth

## The following line maintains both 'git' and 'vim' with all supported package 
#. managers. However, with 'dnf', 'vim' is substituted by 'vim-enhanced'.
#
git vim | dnf: git vim-enhanced

(priority: )      # Return to the default priority of 4096

zsh               # This merely maintains 'zsh'

## The following two packages are maintained with all supported package 
#. managers, but not on macOS or Fedora
#
(os: ! macos fedora) wget curl

## The following line installs the 'chsh' package with all supported package 
#. managers, except:
#.  * with 'dnf', the 'util-linux-user' package is installed instead;
#.  * with 'brew', nothing is installed.
#
chsh | dnf: util-linux-user | brew:
