## Divinefile is a manifest of packages to be installed/removed via system’s 
#. package manager during Divine intervention
#
## Each line contains a list of whitespace-delimited package names
#
## Within a line, every ‘|’ starts an alternative package-list for particular 
#. package manager.
#
## Within an alt-list, everything to the left of first ‘:’ is read as package 
#. manager name, everything to the right — as whitespace-delimited alt-list of 
#. package names.
#
## NOTE: For list of supported package managers, browse through distro adapters 
#. in lib/adapters/distro
#
## If a line contains ‘)’, everything to the left of first ‘)’ is parsed for 
#. space-separated words. First word, if any, is read as priority, second word 
#. as mode, others are ignored. Priority and mode serve the same function as in 
#. *.dpl.sh files.
#
## Priority must be an integer, otherwise it is disregarded in favor of default 
#. value — 4096. Accepted mode values are ‘pa’, ‘pi’, and ‘pr’ (prompt always, 
#. on installation, and on removal, respectively).
#
## Packages are installed in order of ascending numerical priority. For 
#. matching priority, packages are installed in order of appearance in this 
#. file. For removal, the order is fully reversed.
#
## Both ‘#’ and ‘//’ comments are recognized. Whitespace can be freely added 
#. among WORDs and delimiters.
#
## Examples of valid lines:
#
#>  git
#.      Means:
#.    * priority: 4096 (default)
#.    * packages: git
#
#>  300 r) node | apt-get: nodejs npm
#.      Means:
#.    * priority: 300
#.    * mode: ‘always prompt before removing’
#.    * packages (on apt-get): nodejs npm
#.    * packages (anywhere else): node
#
## For more complex installations, e.g., involving particular versions or 
#. special package manager options, look at deployments
